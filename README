simulation layer detached from world chunks and main server thread, to include some features that uses this system, trees that grow over time, potential use of seasons, desire paths

TODO:
=====

design:
-------

internal:

- threading simulation
- scheduled ticking of simulation
- staggered updating of data to chunk data
- granular adjustments based on evaluated pc performance
-- adjust based on loaded chunk count and pc performance
- how to stagger reading of chunk data for simulation

tree:

- figure out a data structure for creating tree profiles
- how to support fruits and their stages

seasons:

- way to cache data weathered elements in a chunk, eg trees, grass, snow addition and removal

desire paths:

- simulate restoration of path

testing:
--------

- find out average performance capability and work out a block update rate based on it
